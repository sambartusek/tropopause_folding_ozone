This code (one Jupyter notebook, some Python scripts, and a Fortran script) should be able to replicate all main and supplementary figures in Bartusek et al., 2023, Geophysical Research Letters, "Higher-resolution tropopause folding accounts for more stratospheric ozone intrusions". Free publicly-available data (ERA5 and CAMSRA output from ECMWF as described in the publication) is necessary. In this repository, "/folding" contains the Fortran tropopause folding identification algorithm and associated files; "/analysis" contains the main analysis notebook (along with an .html that shows it with all the output generated for reference) and fold compositing scripts.
